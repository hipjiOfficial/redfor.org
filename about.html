        <h2>What is redfor.org?</h2>
        <p>Redfor.org is the culmination of my interest in bombline, data, and computers.</p>
        <p>Back in June of 2025, I started tracking the daily shop in a google sheet. In this google sheet I had probabilities calculated, and even automatic log coloring.</p>
        <img src="SiteStyle/SiteImages/THE SHEET.png" alt="The sheet" style="width: 40%; border: 2px solid #eba61b;">
        <p>Eventually the data started growing out of its sheets phase, so I migrated it to PostgreSQL.</p>
        <p>My very first idea was to make a website where you could visit and see the daily shop at any time.</p>
        <p>While a website was my main priority, I started testing what I could do with this data via a discord app, Redfor Bot.</p>
        <img src="SiteStyle/SiteImages/redforbot.png" alt="Redfor Bot" style="width: 40%; border: 2px solid #eba61b;">
        <p>Redfor bot is where I tested features that I would eventually finalize on the website. The basic /getshop command is what drove the /dailyshop page.</p>
        <p>After a few months of screwing around, I finally got redfor.org working.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, during the time it took me to develop redfor.org, bombline saw the biggest dropoff in playercount it had ever experienced.</p>
        <p>As much as I wish that it will, it is my belief that bombline will never recover.</p>
        <p>So if you so much as skimmed redfor.org, thanks a lot.</p>
        <p>For the time being, Redfor.org will receive continuous updates and maintenence, regardless of bombline's popularity.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading, and follow me on <a href="https://github.com/hipjiOfficial" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for more Hipji projects.</p>

        <h2>About new features</h2>
        <p>As stated above, redfor.org will most likely developed further. However, this relies heavily on the time I am able to dedicate.</p>
        <p>Planned features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gallery: A page where you can view all playercards and get database information about them.</li>
            <li>LetMeKnow: Submit your discord username and a playercard to be automatically notified by the bot when your card is in the shop.<br>(This is actually already stubbed out, I just haven't finished the backend. Coming soon.)</li>
            <li>Better Mobile Support: Mobile is buggy as of now.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again this highly depends on how much time I have, but these features I can guarantee to be implemented eventually.</p>
        <p>Any development not listed here is most likely never going to happen.</p>
