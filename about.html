        <h2>What is redfor.org?</h2>
        <p>Redfor.org is the culmination of my love for bombline, data, and computers.</p>
        <p>Back in June of 2025, I started tracking the daily shop in a google sheet. In this google sheet I had probabilities calculated, and even automatic log coloring. Fancy.</p>
        <img src="SiteStyle/SiteImages/THE SHEET.png" alt="The sheet">
        <p>Why I started that I have no idea, but it started growing out of its sheets phase, so I migrated it to PostgreSQL.</p>
        <p>Once there, I decided that I wanted to actually do somthing with this data.</p>
        <p>My very first idea was to make a website where you could visit and see the daily shop at any time.</p>
        <p>While a website was my main priority, I started testing what I could do with this data via a discord app, Redfor Bot.</p>
        <img src="SiteStyle/SiteImages/redforbot.png" alt="Redfor Bot">
        <p>Redfor bot is where I tested features that I would eventually finalize on the website. The basic /getshop command is what drove the /dailyshop page.</p>
        <p>After a few months of screwing around, I finally got redfor.org working.</p>
        <p>Unfortunatley, during the time it took me to develop redfor.org, bombline saw the biggest dropoff in playercount it had ever experienced.</p>
        <p>As much as I wish that it will, it is my belief that bombline will never recover.</p>
        <p>So if you so much as skimmed redfor.org, thank you.</p>
        <p>As for what comes next, I'm not too sure.</p>
        <p>For the time being, Redfor.org will receive continuous updates and maintenence, regardless of bombline's popularity.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading, and follow me on <a href="https://github.com/hipjiOfficial" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for more Hipji projects.</p>
